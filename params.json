The hardest pacman in the world (well, not actually):\r\n\r\n    1 life\r\n    0 energy pills\r\n    4 hungry ghosts\r\n\r\nOnline playable version: http://alfonsonishikawa.github.io/pacman\r\n\r\nDeveloped after 16 hours HTML5/CSS3 course, without formal knowledge of javascript other than some bits read here and there. Don't expect clean, beauty and comprenhensive sourcecode: it's really a mess. The motivation was the execise of DRAWING a Pacman with code in the canvas and \"if much inspired, a ghost too\". The cutted version and for that, hardest, is because implementing more things would take me more time that I want to spend in other projects.\r\nStuff learnt\r\n\r\nAlthough the resulting game is not awesome, actually more like crap (but proud of owns crap), it was very useful to develop the game to learn things:\r\n\r\n    Animations, specially characters animations, must be linked to frames or to real time, but not both.\r\n    Easier is link to frames, but a frameskip controll will be needed for slower devices (we can assume the navigator will limit to max 60fps)\r\n    Linking to timestamp will need a sofisticated behavior control, for example calculating the positions and handling turns.\r\n    I should take a look at some graphics/games library :P\r\n\r\n[Play the game] (pacman/pacman.html)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
